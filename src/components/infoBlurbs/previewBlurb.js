    The preview panel allows you to preview your future GIF either by scrubbing
    through the snapshots with the slider, or by clicking the play/pause button
    on the preview image. The animation will run at (roughly) a speed determined
    by the "Interval" option in the settings panel, so it will give you a good
    idea what the final GIF will look like.
